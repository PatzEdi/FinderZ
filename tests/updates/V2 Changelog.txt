V2 Changelog:
- Release version 2 of FinderZ
- Added full library documentation that explains the code structure and use of each function in detail. 
- Added Regex options to certain functions. This increases the ability to search for specific elements.
- Added backup and synchronization of folders. This is probably the biggest addition in V2! Check the documentation to find out more.
- Added hash computation of files through the hash library.
- Added many new functions to the GatherInfo class.
- IMPORTANT: Removed the 'findFile' function, as the new 'exactSearch' parametric variable is now a part of FinderZ.
- Added 'exactSearch' function for certain functions that before only took in a keyword as an input. Now, you can do file operaions with exact names of files.
- Added the parametric option to scan recursively or just scan single directories to many functions (Before, recursive was always there by default, now you can also manage single directories!).
- Made the parametric 'fileExtension' variable optional under the scanFilesForContent function (Now, by default, all files are include no matter the extension type. But you can specify it if needed!).
- Reconstructed the insertTextInFile function: Now it is much more efficient.
- Improved reliability in certain functions to avoid directory problems.
- Replaced parametric strings and made them more 'global' to avoid confusion.
- Bug fixes and improvements, removed unnecessary lines of code.
- Updated README.
